# Quick start

To start the project run `yarn start`. This command open two new tabs and run Sanity and Gatsby as well as start a browser window to start development.

#### Other commands to note:
`yarn sanity-graphql` - run this after data structure changes  (run from the root)

# Customize

## Gatsby Configuration

To make it easy for you we made sure you can configure as much as possible with the `gatsby-config.js` already.
All you have to do is change the relevant values. For reference you can find an overview of the config below:

```js
siteMetadata: {
  title: 'Level 2',
  titleTemplate: '%s ¬∑ Level 2',
  image: '/images/logo.png',
  author: 'Max Mustermann',
  description: 'Gatsby starter to quickly setup your portfolio and boost it to the next level.',
  url: 'https://knochenmark.github.io',
  paginationPageSize: 4, // Amount of posts displayed per listing page.
},
```

## Icons

Under `src/components/_config` you will find further files that allow for configuration of _social_ and _navigation_ icons.  

Some parts of the app still uses [Font Awsome Solid Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free).

### Navigation

To change or add further menu links you can adjust the maps in `src/components/_config/menu-links.js`.   


### Social

In `src/components/_config/social-icon-list.js` you are able to add further social links or edit the link property to point to your social profiles. Those social links are currently displayed in the _header_ and _footer_. Feel free to reuse them where ever
you like.

## Change the Theme

In order to change the colors of the theme you can just change the values of the css variables in the `src/styles/variables.styl` file. Every color in the _CSS_ is based on those css variables. This allows you to quickly apply a different theme of your choice.

```styl
body
  // Colors
  --bg-color #252839
  --bg-content-color #1b1d2a
  --title-color #fff
  --body-color #ced8de
  --primary-color #F1B631
  --secondary-color #f18731
  // Dimensions & Form
  --radius 6px
  --space 3.5rem
  --header-height 80px
  --content-width 860px
  // Transition Times
  --transition-fast 0.2s
  --transition-normal 0.4s
  --transition-slow 0.6s
  // Misc
  --bg-code rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
  --border-color rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
```
